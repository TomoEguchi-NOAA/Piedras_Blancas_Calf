## INTRODUCTION {.unnumbered}

Eastern North Pacific (ENP) gray whales (*Eschrichtius robustus*)
migrate annually between foraging grounds in the arctic and wintering
grounds in Baja California (Rice and Wolman 1971). Females give birth in
protected lagoons in Baja California Sur, Mexico, and migrate north with
their calves in the spring of each year. Shore-based counts of female
gray whales accompanying their calves (i.e., mother-calf pairs) have been
conducted annually from the Piedras Blancas Lighthouse Station in
central California since 1994. The annual survey was not conducted in 2020 due to COVID-19. Survey methods were evaluated in detail
at the outset of the study [@perryman_gray_2002] and both survey methods
and the analytical approach used to estimate total annual calf
production have remained consistent through the 2019 survey (Perryman et al. 2021).

In 2021, Stewart and Weller (2021a) presented a new Bayesian modeling
approach to estimate annual calf production of ENP gray whales. Their
approach accounted for uncertainty during unsampled periods (i.e., evenings, weekends, and during periods of unworkable weather).
Here we provide estimates of calf production for the 1994-2023 period
using the Bayesian approach.

## METHODS {.unnumbered}

Data for this analysis were collected between 1994-2023 using
standardized methods and processed to be consistent with previous
analyses (Perryman et al. 2002, Weller and Perryman 2019, Stewart and
Weller 2021, Eguchi et al. 2022a). Briefly, a rotating pair of observers
conducted counts of mother-calf pairs from a shore station during a
watch period of, typically, a maximum of 12 hours per day. Watches were
terminated by poor weather (inclement weather, such as rain, fog, etc.),
visibility or sea conditions, resulting in total daily effort frequently
below the maximum of 12 hours.

The annual survey was not conducted in 2020 due to COVID-19. In 2021,
the survey was completed under COVID-related staffing restrictions,
which included a three-person rather than four-person observer rotation
during some weeks. Staffing limitations also resulted in one week of the 2022 survey and two weeks of the 2023 survey being restricted to a three-person team. 
During periods when the three-person rotation was in place, the maximum
survey effort in a given day was limited to 9 hours rather than the
typical 12 hours for a four-person rotation. 

The previous analysis using the method of Perryman et al. (2002) was
based on the following observations and assumptions. Perryman et al.
(2002) determined that: (a) the number of calves passing offshore and
outside of the range of shore-based observers was negligible (data from
aerial surveys) and (b) the passage rates of mother-calf pairs were
consistent between daytime and nighttime periods (based on recording
from infrared sensors). Independent replicate counts from two different
shore-based observation stations conducted over seven consecutive years
(1994-2000) suggested a detection probability of 0.889 (SE = 0.06375)
(Perryman et al. 2002). All of these assumptions were maintained for the
method of Stewart and Weller (2021) and the analysis presented here.

Raw data were processed to reflect the total number of calves passing
within four 3-hour periods per day and the survey effort per 3-hour
period following Weller and Perryman (2019). The method of Perryman et
al (2002) used direct corrections for detection probability and effort
to generate total calf production estimates. For example, if 2 calves
were observed passing during a 3-hour period, that would be corrected
for detection probability by dividing the total observed calves 0.889,
for a total estimate of 2.247 calves for that 3-hour period. The
detection probability-corrected calf counts were then summed for each
1-week period. Then, to account for both the portions of 3-hour watches
that were terminated by poor conditions, and the unobserved night and
weekend periods, the weekly total counts were multiplied by the number
of hours in a week (168) divided by the total weekly effort. In 2016,
for example, 22 calves were counted during the third week of survey
effort (April 12-16). This was corrected to 24.747 calves to account for
detection probability. There were 39.6 total hours of survey effort
during that week, so the final estimate was 24.747 \* (168/39.6) =
104.99. The same calculation was made for each week of the survey, and
summed across weeks for a total calf estimate. Variance was incorporated
via Taylor series expansion from the variance in estimated detection
probability, the number of survey days, and the variance in the
corrected total number of animals passing per 3-hour period (Weller and
Perryman 2019).

Details of the analytical model can be found in Stewart and Weller (2021) and Eguchi et al. (2022a).

In some years, a survey was concluded mid-week after three consecutive
days of 0 sightings of calves. In these cases, we populated the
remainder of the final week with 0 sighting and 0 effort survey periods
to maintain consistency across weeks. Migration start and end dates
differed across years, and therefore the number of weeks surveyed were
not consistent across years, but were instead designed to capture the
full northbound migration from start to finish.

We compared estimated calf production with estimated abundance of gray

between `r min(MC_Nhats$Year)` and `r max(MC_Nhats$Year)` ranged from

Our shore-based surveys of gray whales conducted from the Piedras
Blancas Light Station would not be possible without the support and
hospitality provided by U.S. Department of Interior's Bureau of Land
Management. We are particularly indebted to the support provided by John
Bogacki, Jim Boucher, Ryan Cooper, and Jodie Nelson. A long list of
talented field biologists contributed to this data set but the
contributions by Richard Rowlett, Susan Chivers, Morgan Lynn, and Jim
Gilpatrick stand out because of their talents and dedication over 20
years of survey effort reported herein. Wayne Perryman pioneered this
study in 1994 and lead the field effort for more than 20 years. His
contributions to the science and fun of the project have everything to
do with its enduring quality and success.
