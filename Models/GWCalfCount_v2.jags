# in this version (v2), I add years into the model
# Strangely, the Total.Calves tally increase as the number of 
# datasets increases... running n.years = 1 has the lowest
# total counts. As n.years increases, the numbers increase for 
# all years. I can't figure out what is going on here because
# the years are independent of each other, as far as I can tell
# in this model.

# Decided to use v1 for each dataset. I have to get
# to the bottom of this. 2022-05-04
